+ **Developer Portal and REST API Reference Documentation**
  + [Product one](https://docs.chainalysis.com/api/kyt/)
  + [Product two](https://docs.chainalysis.com/api/address-screening/)
  + [Product three](https://docs.chainalysis.com/api/sanctions/)

+ **Python Scraper and Corresponding Tutorial**
  + I created a Python-based web scraper to extract winemaker profiles from the various online sources, translate the text to English, and store the gathered data in a CSV file. Alongside the script, I crafted an in-depth tutorial that guides readers through the process of building the web scraper, explaining the purpose and functionality of each code segment. To explore the script or review the tutorial, visit its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nateKlaux/winemaker_scraper) or corresponding [README.md file](https://github.com/nateKlaux/winemaker_scraper/blob/main/README.md).

+ **Hugo and GitHub Pages Tutorial**
  + I created a Hugo + GitHub Pages [tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JYPjooOLoJ0ZFeckv55zBsMoZhgasVCp/view?usp=sharing). As a beginner, building and hosting a static web page is confusing. This tutorial addresses that gap and aims to simplify both the concepts and steps. As well, it displays my technical writing competencies and showcases my proficiency with Markdown, command-line Git, and static site generators. I created this tutorial in Markdown and then converted it to a pdf for simple distribution.

+ **OpenAPI Specification Example**
  + I reworked an [API](https://laux.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-cio-sample/reference/Behavioral-Tracking-API.v1.yaml) into an OpenAPI Spec definition. Using Stoplight, I gave developers a "try it out" feature that makes testing APIs easy. This example shows my familiarity with OpenAPI Specification as well as JSON and YAML data serialization formats.

+ **API Reference (SurfReport)**
  + I created this [API Reference sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P04OB09TeNchCXo5D6YbkMAzBC8_3DW6/view?usp=sharing) in a Documenting APIs course. It shows my familiarity with the usual contents of API reference docs. Written in Markdown and published as pdf for easy distribution.

<!-- + **Salesforce Chatter Flowchart**
  + I created this [diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19UmcfeZD-umGdoBI-4Jk7XQeFqslCD3t/view?usp=sharing) with LucidChart, but it showcases my capabilities with diagramming tools in general (LucidChart, Visio, Omnigraffle, etc.). It uses best practices in regards to diagram shapes. I created the diagram to illustrate to a new team how to use Salesforce Chatter to provide feedback regarding new release notes.

+ **Salesforce User Guide**
  + This [user guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5vYRnWywGWHqV2h9L4DAyEqBRppA8vA/view?usp=sharing) demonstrates my proficiency with screen captures and procedure writing.

+ **Translation Poster**
  + This [sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p7ppTo3-4NjgPO4JilK9Uu0tgEpgQB-n/view?usp=sharing) shows my ability to translate complex language into concrete, actionable text. -->
