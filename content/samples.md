+ **Python Scraper and Corresponding Tutorial**
  + I created a Python-based web scraper to extract winemaker profiles from the various online sources, translate the text to English, and store the gathered data in a CSV file. Alongside the script, I crafted an in-depth tutorial that guides readers through the process of building the web scraper, explaining the purpose and functionality of each code segment. To explore the script or review the tutorial, visit its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nateKlaux/winemaker_scraper) or corresponding [README.md file](https://github.com/nateKlaux/winemaker_scraper/blob/main/README.md).

+ **Hugo and GitHub Pages Tutorial**
  + I created a [Hugo + GitHub Pages tutorial](/files/Hugo_GitHub_Pages_Tutorial.pdf), specifically tailored for those new to the field of technical writing. Building and hosting a static web page can be a daunting task for beginners, and this tutorial aims to bridge that gap by simplifying both the concepts and the steps involved. Additionally, it demonstrates my technical writing competencies, showcasing my proficiency with Markdown, command-line Git, and static site generators. I created this tutorial in Markdown and then converted it to a pdf for simpler distribution.

+ **OpenAPI Specification Example**
  + I reworked an [API](https://laux.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-cio-sample/reference/Behavioral-Tracking-API.v1.yaml) into an OpenAPI Spec definition. Utilizing Stoplight, I provided developers with a "try it out" feature that simplifies API testing. This example demonstrates my proficiency in the OpenAPI Specification, as well as my knowledge of JSON and YAML data serialization formats.

+ **API Reference (SurfReport)**
  + I created an [API Reference sample](/files/SurfReport_API_Reference.pdf) during a Documenting APIs course to highlight my familiarity with the typical components found in API reference documentation. This sample showcases my proficiency in creating informative and accessible API documentation. I created this sample with Markdown and then converted it to a pdf for simpler distribution.

<!-- + **Salesforce Chatter Flowchart**
  + I created this [diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19UmcfeZD-umGdoBI-4Jk7XQeFqslCD3t/view?usp=sharing) with LucidChart, but it showcases my capabilities with diagramming tools in general (LucidChart, Visio, Omnigraffle, etc.). It uses best practices in regards to diagram shapes. I created the diagram to illustrate to a new team how to use Salesforce Chatter to provide feedback regarding new release notes.

+ **Salesforce User Guide**
  + This [user guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5vYRnWywGWHqV2h9L4DAyEqBRppA8vA/view?usp=sharing) demonstrates my proficiency with screen captures and procedure writing.

+ **Translation Poster**
  + This [sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p7ppTo3-4NjgPO4JilK9Uu0tgEpgQB-n/view?usp=sharing) shows my ability to translate complex language into concrete, actionable text. -->
