+ **Hugo and GitHub Pages Tutorial**
  + I created a Hugo + GitHub Pages [tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ug2zY8qyH0SyTkbnqFV-b4aCbCqfEsrR/view?usp=sharing). Hugo's documentation for hosting a webpage with GitHub Pages is sparse and potentially confusing, especially for those with little familiarity with static site generators. This tutorial mitigates the problem by simplifying both the concepts and steps. As well as display general technical writing competencies, it showcases my proficiency with Markdown, command-line Git, and static site generators. Written in Markdown and published in pdf for easy distribution.

+ **OpenAPI Specification Example**
  + I integrated an [API](https://laux.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-cio-sample/reference/Behavioral-Tracking-API.v1.yaml) into OpenAPI Spec using Stoplight Studio. By using Stoplight, I gave developers a "try it out" feature that makes testing APIs easy. This example shows my familiarity with OpenAPI Specification as well as JSON and YAML data serialization formats.

+ **API Reference (SurfReport)**
  + I created this [API Reference sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P04OB09TeNchCXo5D6YbkMAzBC8_3DW6/view?usp=sharing) in a Documenting APIs course. It shows my familiarity of the usual contents of API reference docs. Written in Markdown and published as pdf for easy distribution.

+ **Salesforce User Guide**
  + This [user guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5vYRnWywGWHqV2h9L4DAyEqBRppA8vA/view?usp=sharing) demonstrates my proficiency with screen captures and procedure writing.

+ **Translation Poster**
  + This [sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p7ppTo3-4NjgPO4JilK9Uu0tgEpgQB-n/view?usp=sharing) shows my ability to translate complex language into concrete, actionable text.
