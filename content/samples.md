+ **Hugo and GitHub Pages Tutorial**
  + I created a Hugo + GitHub Pages [tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JYPjooOLoJ0ZFeckv55zBsMoZhgasVCp/view?usp=sharing). Hugo's documentation for hosting a webpage with GitHub Pages is sparse and potentially confusing for those with little familiarity of static site generators. This tutorial mitigates that problem by simplifying both the concepts and steps. As well as display general technical writing competencies, it showcases my proficiency with Markdown, command-line Git, and static site generators. It was written in Markdown, but converted and published in pdf for easy distribution.

+ **OpenAPI Specification Example**
  + I reworked an [API](https://laux.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-cio-sample/reference/Behavioral-Tracking-API.v1.yaml) into an OpenAPI Spec definition. By using Stoplight, I gave developers a "try it out" feature that makes testing APIs easy. This example shows my familiarity with OpenAPI Specification as well as JSON and YAML data serialization formats.

+ **API Reference (SurfReport)**
  + I created this [API Reference sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P04OB09TeNchCXo5D6YbkMAzBC8_3DW6/view?usp=sharing) in a Documenting APIs course. It shows my familiarity of the usual contents of API reference docs. Written in Markdown and published as pdf for easy distribution.

+ **Salesforce Chatter Flowchart**
  + I created this [diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19UmcfeZD-umGdoBI-4Jk7XQeFqslCD3t/view?usp=sharing) with LucidChart, but it showcases my capabilities with diagramming tools in general (LucidChart, Visio, Omnigraffle, etc.). It uses best practices in regards to diagram shapes. I created the diagram to illustrate to a new team how to use Salesforce Chatter to provide feedback regarding new release notes.

+ **Salesforce User Guide**
  + This [user guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5vYRnWywGWHqV2h9L4DAyEqBRppA8vA/view?usp=sharing) demonstrates my proficiency with screen captures and procedure writing.

+ **Translation Poster**
  + This [sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p7ppTo3-4NjgPO4JilK9Uu0tgEpgQB-n/view?usp=sharing) shows my ability to translate complex language into concrete, actionable text.
