###### Technical Writer, Chainalysis

_March 2021 - Present_

At Chainalysis, I focus on delivering clear, accurate, and user-centric content for our API, SDK, and UI users in a docs-as-code environment. I collaborate cross-functionally with Product Managers, Engineering Managers, Product Design, Product Marketing, and Customer Support to ensure documentation meets both technical and business requirements. I own the documentation process from start to finish, from planning through delivery and maintenance.

**Key achievements:**

- Led the migration of legacy documentation to a modern platform that reduced internal engineering cost, enhanced user experience with improved design and usability, and decreased average user onboarding time.
- Established company-wide documentation standards and information architecture that scaled to support a 3x growth in product offerings.
- Developed Python automation scripts that reduced documentation update time.
