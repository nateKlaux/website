I am a technical writer with an educational background in philosophy and a diverse range of experiences. During my career, I have continually translated complexity, initially in the realm of academic philosophy, then as a copyeditor, and now as a technical writer. Throughout, I have developed excellent writing, research, communication, and collaboration skills.
