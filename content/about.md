I'm a Technical Writer who thrives on transforming complex developer concepts into clear, actionable documentation. With experience across blockchain, financial compliance, and investigations technology, I specialize in creating documentation that serves both technical and business needs.

My expertise includes crafting comprehensive API, SDK, and UI documentation in docs-as-code environments. I excel in information architecture and documentation automation, which paired with programming abilities for testing APIs, validating code examples, and building documentation tools, ensures documentation that truly serves customers.

Based in Los Angeles.
